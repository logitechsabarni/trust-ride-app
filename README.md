Hello everyone,
I’m excited to present our project Trust Ride – Safe & Verified Journeys.

We built Trust Ride to solve one of the biggest issues in ride-hailing today: lack of transparency and safety. Passengers often don’t know if a driver’s information is genuine, ride data can be manipulated, and when emergencies happen, there’s little accountability.

Our solution combines blockchain and AI to create a safety-first ride-hailing platform.

Driver Verification: Every driver registers with a license, and their verification is stored immutably on blockchain. Once verified, it cannot be faked or tampered with.

Ride Records: Each ride automatically generates a blockchain transaction hash, meaning ride details are permanently logged and transparent.

Safety Alerts: Riders have access to a panic button during trips. If triggered, an alert is recorded on blockchain, timestamped, and visible in the dashboard as undeniable proof.

User Experience: The app starts with a signup/login page powered by Google authentication. Riders can book rides, drivers can manage trips, and both can track verification status through a clean dashboard.

We also created a Blockchain Dashboard, where all verification statuses, ride hashes, and safety alerts can be monitored in real time. This creates trust between drivers, riders, and regulators.

Technically, we’ve used React and Node.js for the app, PostgreSQL for data, Google Auth for login, and integrated a mock blockchain layer for immutable records. The design emphasizes safety, transparency, and ease of use.

In short, Trust Ride makes urban commuting safer by ensuring that safety you can trust is backed by evidence you can verify.

Thank you.
